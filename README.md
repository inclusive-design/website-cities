# Co-designing Inclusive Cities

This repository contains the website for the [Co-Designing Inclusive Cities project](https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca).

## Building the site

This website is made with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.

For details on downloading and installing Hugo, please see the ["Install Hugo" section of the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

Hugo includes a built-in webserver that can be used to serve up the Hugo-processed site content for viewing locally. It has live-reload functionality that will reload content as it's edited on disk. The webserver can be run with:

    > hugo server

Alternatively, running Hugo without the `server` command will generate the static site files and write them to a directory on disk called `public/`:

    > hugo

For more information on Hugo, please see the [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/).
