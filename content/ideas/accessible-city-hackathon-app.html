title: Accessible City Hackathon Application: OCADU + Sidewalk Labs
date: "2018-09-07"
---

<p>Throughout August and September, Sidewalk Labs partnered with the Inclusive Design Research Centre at the Ontario College of Art and Design to facilitate three co-design sessions to inform our accessibility principles and planning work. This was a fantastic opportunity to brainstorm, workshop and co-create ideas for potential accessible city systems with people who identify as part of the accessibility community in Toronto.</p>
<p>Now, we're continuing the work with a hackathon to start building prototypes and testing out how some of these ideas might work!</p>
<p>WHEN: Friday, September 21, 2018, 9am-7pm</p>
<p>WHERE: 307 Lakeshore Blvd E, Toronto, ON M5A 1C1, Canada <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/y4W7ruWqGmE2">https://goo.gl/maps/y4W7ruWqGmE2</a></p>
<p>WHAT: â‰ˆ10 implementable ideas that came out of the co-design sessions will each be synthesized into one-page design challenges, which list the required features and intended use cases for the project. Each hackathon team (consisting of a design/product resource, two engineers/makers, and at least one person from the accessibility community) will have the whole day to build a prototype that fits the design challenge requirements.</p>
<p>PRIZES: Successful projects will have the opportunity to be displayed at 307 during the public Open Sidewalk on the Accessible City on Saturday, Sept 22.</p>
<p>WHO: We're looking for engineers, product designers, and folks with lived experience in accessibility and inclusive design to spend a day with the Sidewalk engineering team and our OCADU partners to build these prototypes!</p>
<p>HOW MANY: We have 50 spots available, and we'll try to get a good balance of different skill sets and backgrounds. Apply using this form and we'll follow up to let you know whether we can offer you a spot.</p>
