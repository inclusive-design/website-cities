title: "Image Description for the Co-design Session #2 Prototype Discussion Whiteboard"
---

Whiteboard of notes on the discussion of the 5 prototypes. Each group described their prototype, presented their initial process, and discussed the critiques they received. Relink created a multisensory information kiosk. Boulevard created an embedded tactile strip system which also feeds information to an app. Sweet Streets created hexagonal street pavers with dynamic abilities to add or remove tactile strips/bumps. Harmony created an optimized intersection with dynamic signs and an associated app. Side Thoughts created a pedestrian and community focused neighbourhood with a colour and texture coded wayfinding system indicating cardinal directions.

## Relink group

- Kiosk
    - create multisensory @ intersections
    - interface is AI about surroundings (ASL, braille, CC)
- Criticism
    - navigation dependent on tech
    - how to customize to various tech (w/c, scooters...)
        - can use voice recognition
        - solar powered
    - not useful for cars {{< arrow >}} mainly for pedestrians
        - give extra time to cross street based on signal
        - motion sensor {{< arrow >}} activated when someone walks close
- What info?
    - any kind of info
    - directions
    - like cellphone
    - accessibility (tactile map, move up & down, may options)

## Boulevard group

- Tactile strip down center of all sidewalks
    - into streets & change @ transitions
    - embed info into tactile strip to work w/tech & GPS
    - audio information
        - speakers
        - come out @ you as you walk from tiles
- Critique
    - didn't go over how pedestrians know where/when crossing {{< arrow >}} vibration {{< arrow >}} button or voice control
    - tweak style of walk & don't walk to reduce glare {{< arrow >}} separate w/green/red system
    - strip a couple of inches wide based on what's happening on street
        - interacts w/smartphone {{< arrow >}} embedded in tactile strip
    - allow someone to walk from point A {{< arrow >}} B "follow the yellow brick road"
    - robots @ intersection to help people cross street
    - trying to use sound as a cue if embedded in pavers (already exists) {{< arrow >}} more effective @ eye level
    - adapt to weather? - heated therefore no snow {{< arrow >}} hopefully rubber tactile strip

## Sweet Streets group

- Hexagons {{< arrow >}} divots {{< arrow >}} allows tactile feature that are dynamic
    - have retractable braille trail {{< arrow >}} walkway (braille) vs road (smooth)
        - changes based on person
        - just like the lights
- Critique
    - supported for people who use beacons & landmarks
        - landmark stable but info changed w/ area around it
        - landmark are all same {{< arrow >}} can be moved like bollard
            - press button to give you information about where you are
    - vertigo/dementia {{< arrow >}} is braille trail the entire sidewalk {{< arrow >}} on the edges {{< arrow >}} passageway itself is smooth
    - who decides when streets are what? {{< arrow >}} considered in future prototyping & implementation
    - giving the people who use to decide
        - government need to approve
        - during planning phase
    - why hexagons?
        - strength/flexibility {{< arrow >}} SWL to share info after
        - engineers should consider further research RE: surface

## Harmony group

- Optimize intersection
    - designed to reduce conflict & optimized for pedestrians
        - price cost of demand to control traffic flow
    - staggered car/bike stops {{< arrow >}} priority @ intersection
    - price of blocking @ intersection
    - audio signals for wayfinding
    - new signs
    - pedestrian priority signal
- Critique
    - reading/language/cognitive barriers
        - too much going on
        - app in car w/ transponder
        - digital signs {{< arrow >}} show most impt msg
    - people w/ financial barriers
        - moved pricing w/n app in car {{< arrow >}} location-based
        - # of people in car to adjust pricing {{< arrow >}} income-based
    - Bike land/road {{< arrow >}} Bollards
        - challenge = resolving conflict
    - Tourists {{< arrow >}} complicated system {{< arrow >}} pricing {{< arrow >}} political debate
        - non-local license plate not charged
        - only cars
            - promote active transport
            - logistical reasons

## Side Thoughts group

- Pedestrian/community focused
    - cars@perimeter, pedestrians centre
- encourage pedestrian traffic & community
    - like plaza {{< arrow >}} hexagons inside
- coded indicators
    - cardinal directions
        - color/texture/haptic based
        - always know where N is
        - not direction of flow but where they are right now
- Critique
    - lots of ways to navigate
        - digital kiosks on buildings themselves
        - physical navigation
    - maximizing space
        - challenge traditions of our current urban space
        - rethinking approach how to navigate urban space
            - treat like adventure & enjoyment {{< arrow >}} change culture
    - referencing super block model from Barcelona
        - multiple benefits
    - each doors@building has screen
        - info is on things that don't change
